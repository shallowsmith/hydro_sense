# Microcontroller Team

### Members: James Kim, Drew Tom, Michelle Kim

## Our Goal

Our objective as the Microcontroller Team for the HydroSense project is to establish a robust microcontroller-based system capable of data acquisition, storage, visualization from the moisture sensor, and seamless integration via RESTful APIs. We aim to provide a reliable foundation for real-time sensing and data management.
